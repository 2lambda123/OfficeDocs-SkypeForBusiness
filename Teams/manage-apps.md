# Manage Teams apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center

You manage apps for your organization in **Teams apps** in the admin center. Use the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page to view and manage all Teams apps in your organization's app catalog. The Manage apps page gives you a view into all available apps in your tenant catalog, providing you with the information you need to decide which apps to allow or block across your organization. You can see the org-level status and properties of apps, block or allow apps at the org level, upload new custom apps to your tenant catalog, and manage org-wide app settings.

![Screenshot of the Manage apps page.](media/manage-apps.png)

To manage apps, you use the following policies to control permissions for users, installation of apps, and upload of custom apps created within your organization. To understand policies, see [Overview of app policies](app-policies.md).

To read about getting admin roles and permissions, see [Teams administrator roles](./using-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [new-teams-sfb-admin-center-notice](includes/new-teams-sfb-admin-center-notice.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The Manage apps page isn't available in Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud High (GCCH) or Department of Defense (DoD) deployments of Teams.

<!--- TBD: This info belongs in the app policy overview article. Title it as mentioned in the spreadsheet.

* **App permission policy**: With it, you can control what apps are available to specific users in your organization. You can allow or block all apps or specific apps published by Microsoft, third-parties, and your organization. See [Manage app permission policies in Teams](teams-app-permission-policies.md).
* **App setup policies**: It lets you customize the app experience for your users. You choose the apps that you want to pin to the app bar in the Teams clients and the order in which they appear, on web, desktop, and mobile clients. See [Manage app setup policies in Teams](teams-app-setup-policies.md).
* **Custom app policies and settings**: Teams allows developers in your organization to build, test, and deploy custom apps to other users. Custom apps can be added to Teams by uploading an app package in a .zip file directly to a team or in the personal context. You can use app setup policies to control who in your organization can upload custom apps. You can also set org-wide settings to control whether users can interact with specific custom apps. See [Manage custom app policies and settings in Teams](teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings).

The following are the important use cases you can accomplish via the the Manage apps page:

* [Allow or block apps at the org level](#allow-and-block-apps)
* [Apps blocked by publishers](#apps-blocked-by-publishers)
* [Add apps to teams](#add-an-app-to-a-team)
* [Approve or upload new custom apps to your organization's app store](#publish-a-custom-app-to-your-organizations-app-store)
* [View permissions requested by apps](#view-resource-specific-consent-permissions)
* [Grant consent to apps](#grant-admin-consent-to-apps)
* [Purchase service for third-party apps](#purchase-services-for-third-party-apps)
* [See org-level status and properties of apps](#view-apps)
* [Manage org-wide app settings](#manage-org-wide-app-settings)
* [View security and compliance information for Microsoft 365 Certified apps](#view-security-and-compliance-information-for-microsoft-365-certified-apps)

<!--- TBD: Commenting for now in favor of the definition list above: 

The Manage apps page gives you a view into all available apps, providing you with the information you need to decide which apps to allow or block across your organization. You can then use [app permission policies](teams-app-permission-policies.md), [app setup policies](teams-app-setup-policies.md), and [custom app policies and settings](teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings.md) to configure the app experience for specific users in your organization.

In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**. You must be a global admin or Teams service admin to access the page.

--->

<!--- TBD: Move this view apps section to a new article about navigating and understanding TAC. It is yet to be created.

## View apps

You can view every app including the following information about each app.

![Screenshot of the apps details page for an app.](media/app-detail-page.jpg)

- **Name**: The app name. Select the app name to go to the app details page to see more information about the app. This includes a description of the app, whether it's allowed or blocked, version, privacy policy, terms of use, categories that apply to the app, certification status, supported capabilities, and app ID.
- **Certification**: If the app has gone through certification, you'll see either **Microsoft 365 certified** or **Publisher attestation**. Select the link to view certification details for the app. If you see `--`, we don't have certification information for the app. To learn more about certified apps in Teams, read [Microsoft 365 App Certification program](/microsoft-365-app-certification/overview).
- **Publisher**: Name of the publisher.
- **Publishing status**: Publishing status of custom apps.
- **Status**: Status of the app at the org level, which can be one of the following:
  - **Allowed**: The app is available for all users in your organization.
  - **Blocked**: The app is blocked and not available for any users in your organization.
  - **Blocked by publisher**: The app is blocked by the publisher and is hidden from end-users by default. After you set up the app using the publisher's guidance, you can allow or block the app to make it available to end-users.
  - **Blocked org-wide**: The app is blocked in org-wide app settings.
      It's important to know that this column represents the allowed and blocked status of apps that were formerly on the **Org-wide settings** pane. You now view, block, and allow apps at the org-wide on the **Manage apps** page.
- **Licenses**: Indicates whether an app offers a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription for purchase. This column applies only to third-party apps. Each third-party app will have one of the following values:
  - **Purchase**: The app offers a SaaS subscription and is available to purchase.  
  - **Purchased**: The app offers a SaaS subscription and you've purchased licenses for it.
  - **- -**: The app doesn't offer a SaaS subscription.
- **Custom app**: Whether the app is a custom app.
- **Permissions**: Indicates whether a third-party or custom app that's registered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) has permissions that need consent. You'll see one of the following values:
  - **View details**: The app has permissions that require consent before the app can access data.
  - **- -**: The app doesn't have permissions that need consent.
- **Categories**: Categories that apply to the app.
- **Version**: App version.
- **Admin can install in meetings**: Indicates whether an app can be installed by admins in Team meetings. [Learn more](teams-app-setup-policies.md#install-apps)

To see the information that you want in the table, select **Edit Column** in the upper-right corner to add or remove columns to the table.

## Publish a custom app to your organization's app store

Use the Manage apps page to publish apps that are built specifically for your organization. After you publish a custom app, it's available to users in your organization's app store. There are two ways to publish a custom app to your organization's app store. The way that you use depends on how you get the app.

* [Approve a custom app](#approve-a-custom-app): Use this method if the developer submits the app directly to the Manage apps page using the Teams App Submission API. You can then review and publish (or reject) the app directly from the app details page.
* [Upload an app package](#upload-an-app-package): Use this method if the developer sends you the app package in .zip format. You publish the app by uploading the app package.

### Approve a custom app

The **Pending approvals** widget on the Manage apps page notifies you when a developer submits an app by using the Teams App Submission API. A newly submitted app is listed with a **Publishing status** of **Submitted** and an **Status** of **Blocked**. Go to the app details page to see more information about the app, and then to publish it, set **Publishing status** to **Publish**.

You're also notified when a developer submits an update to a custom app. You can then review and publish (or reject) the update on the app details page. All app permission policies and app setup policies remain enforced for the updated app.

To learn more, see [Publish a custom app submitted through the Teams App Submission API](submit-approve-custom-apps.md).

### Upload an app package

The developer creates a Teams app package using [Teams App Studio](/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-app-studio), and then sends it to you in .zip format. When you have the app package, you can upload it to your organization's app store.

To upload a new custom app, select **Upload** to upload the app package. The app isn't highlighted after it's uploaded so you'll need to search the list of apps on the Manage apps page to find it.

To update an app after it's uploaded, in the list of apps on the Manage apps page, select the app name, and then select **Update**. Doing this replaces the existing app and all app permission policies and app setup policies remain enforced for the updated app.

To learn more, see [Publish a custom app by uploading an app package](upload-custom-apps.md).

## Allow and block apps

The Manage apps page is where you allow or block individual apps at the org level. It shows every available app and its current org-level app status. (Blocking and allowing apps at the org level has moved from the **Org-wide app settings** pane to here.)

To allow or block an app, select it, and then select **Allow** or **Block**. When you block an app, all interactions with that app are disabled and the app doesn't appear in Teams for any users in your organization.

When you block or allow an app on the Manage apps page, that app is blocked or allowed for all users in your organization.  When you block or allow an app in a Teams app permission policy, it's blocked or allowed for users who are assigned that policy. For a user to be able to install and interact with any app, you must allow the app at the org level on the Manage apps page and in the app permission policy that's assigned to the user.

 > [!NOTE]
 > To uninstall an app, right-click the app, and then click **Uninstall** or use the **More apps** menu on the left side.

## Apps blocked by publishers

When an ISV publishes an app to the global app store, they might need admins to configure or customize the app experience. The admin can make it available to end-users when the app is fully set up.

For example, Contoso Electronics is an ISV that built a help desk app for Microsoft Teams. Contoso Electronics wants its customers to set up certain properties of the app so that when users interact with the app, it functions as expected. Before an admin can allow or block the application, it will show as **Blocked by publisher** in the Teams admin center and will be hidden from end-users by default. After following the publisher's guidance to set up the app, you can make it available to users by changing to status to **Allowed**, or block users from using the app by changing the status to **Blocked**.

![Screenshot of blocked by publisher status in teams admin center.](media/blocked-by-publisher.png)

## Add an app to a team

You use the **Add to team** button to install an app to a team. Keep in mind that this is only for apps that can be installed in a team scope. The **Add to team** button isn't available for apps that can only be installed in the personal scope.

![Screenshot of Add to team button.](media/manage-apps-add-app-team.png)

1. Search for the app you want, and then select the app by clicking to the left of the app name.
1. Select **Add to team**.
1. In the **Add to team** pane, search for the team you want to add the app to, select the team, and then select **Apply**.

## Customize an app

You can now customize an app to include a specific look and feel according to your organization needs. See [Customize apps in Teams](customize-apps.md).

## Purchase services for third-party apps

You can search for and purchase licenses for services offered by third-party apps for users in your organization directly from the Manage apps page. The **Licenses** column in the table indicates whether an app offers a paid SaaS subscription. Select **Purchase now** to view plans and pricing information and buy licenses for your users. To learn more, see [Purchase services for Teams third-party apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](purchase-third-party-apps.md).

## Grant admin consent to apps

You can review and grant consent to apps that request permissions on behalf of all users in your organization. You do this so that users don't have to review and accept the permissions requested by the app when they start the app. The **Permissions** column indicates whether an app has permissions that need consent. You'll see a **View details** link for each app registered in Azure AD that has permissions that need consent. To learn more, see [View app permissions and grant admin consent in the Microsoft Teams admin center](app-permissions-admin-center.md).

## View resource-specific consent permissions

Resource-specific consent (RSC) permissions let team owners grant consent for an app to access and modify a team's data. RSC permissions are granular, Teams-specific permissions that define what an app can do in a specific team. You can view RSC permissions on the **Permissions** tab of the app details page for an app. To learn more, see [View app permissions and grant admin consent in the Microsoft Teams admin center](app-permissions-admin-center.md).

## Manage org-wide app settings

Use org-wide app settings to control whether users with an [F license](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline#office-SKUChooser-0dbn8nt) get the tailored frontline app experience, whether users can install third-party apps, and whether users can upload or interact with custom apps in your organization. Org-wide app settings govern the behavior for all users and override any other app permission policies assigned to users. You can use them to control malicious or problematic apps.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to use org-wide app settings in Microsoft 365 Government - Government Community Cloud High GCCH and Department of Defense (DoD) deployments of Teams, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

1. On the Manage apps page, select **Org-wide app settings**. You can then configure the settings you want in the pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-apps-org-wide-app-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Org-wide app settings pane on the Manage apps page":::

1. Under **Tailored apps**, turn off or turn on **Show tailored apps**. When this setting is on, users with an [F license](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline#office-SKUChooser-0dbn8nt) get the tailored frontline app experience. This experience pins the most relevant apps in Teams for frontline workers. To learn more, see [Tailor Teams apps for your frontline workers](pin-teams-apps-based-on-license.md).

    This feature is available for F licenses. Other license types will be supported in the future.
1. Under **Third-party apps**, turn off or turn on these settings to control access to third-party apps:

    - **Allow third-party apps**: This controls whether users can use third-party apps. If you turn off this setting, your users won't be able to install or use any third-party apps and the app status of these apps is displayed as **Blocked org-wide** in the table.

        > [!NOTE]
        > When **Allow third-party apps** is off, [outgoing webhooks](/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors) are still enabled for all users, but you can control them at the user level by allowing or blocking the Outgoing Webhook app through [app permission policies](teams-app-permission-policies.md). Note that if you have existing [app permission policies](teams-app-permission-policies.md) for **Microsoft apps** that use the **Allow specific apps and block all others** setting, and you want to enable outgoing webhooks for users, add the Outgoing Webhook app to the list.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Teams users can add apps when they host meetings or chats with people from other organizations. They can also use apps shared by people in other organizations when they join meetings or chats hosted by those organizations. The data policies of the hosting user's organization, as well as the data sharing practices of any third-party apps shared by that user's organization, are applied.

    - **Allow any new third-party apps published to the store by default**: This controls whether new third-party apps that are published to the Teams app store become automatically available in Teams. You can only set this option if you allow third-party apps.

1. Under **Custom apps**, turn off or turn on **Allow interaction with custom apps**. This setting controls whether users can interact with custom apps. To learn more, see [Manage custom app policies and settings in Teams](teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings.md).
1. Select **Save** for org-wide app settings to take effect.

<!--- TBD: Commenting this info for now. Move it later to the new article about compliance program and how/where admins can find info about compliant apps.

## View security and compliance information for Microsoft 365 Certified apps

When evaluating an app for their organization, admins can use independent Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), such as Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS), to find information about security and behaviors of an app. The Teams admin center includes security and compliance information from MCAS for Microsoft 365 Certified apps so you'll have more information on whether or not the app meets your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to all admins, whether or not your organization has a license that supports MCAS.

To access MCAS information, follow these steps:

1. In the Teams admin center, select **Manage apps** under **Teams apps**.
1. Select **Certification** to sort apps and push all Microsoft 365 Certified apps to the top of the table.
1. Choose a Microsoft 365 Certified app.
1. Select the **Security and compliance** tab.

![Screenshot of Teams admin center security and compliance tab.](media/mcas.png)

On this tab, you'll find information on security, compliance, and data protection. You can also expand each dropdown list to get more details about which capabilities are supported for the selected application.
