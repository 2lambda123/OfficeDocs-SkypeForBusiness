    -   MTR with Pro or Premium license is required to enable
        IntelliFrame, and people recognition features on MTR.

    -   Basic license will not enable IntelliFrame or people
        recognition. If you have Basic, Camera only shows Active Speaker
        and Panoramic views.

    -   Refer to this
        [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/license-check#check-the-license-of-a-couple-teams-rooms-devices)
        on how to determine if you have the right license. [Find Teams
        Rooms devices with unsupported licenses - Microsoft Teams \|

        Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/license-check#check-the-license-of-a-couple-teams-rooms-devices)

-   MTR Enrolled in TAP (Ring 1.5), and Participant Teams app on PC must
    also be in Ring 1.5.

-   Set policy for "People Recognition" and "Enrollment" (See below
    [section 4.5](#enabling-enrollment-option-and-people-recognition)
    for more info).

-   Configure MTR for log collection and Feedback (bug filing)

## Device Provisioning

### Placing and Fixing "SmartVision 60" to conf room table

SmartVision 60 camera is a "Center of room" 360-degree camera, that is
meant to be placed at the center of meeting room table where there is a
clear view between camera and meeting attendees. We recommend the device
to be placed at the center of the table, but no more than 10 feet from
the MTR console.

Once placed on the table, use the supplied 3M sticky pads to adhere the
device to the table and ensure the device is firmly placed and is not
easily movable. Orientation of the device is critical to its function so
ensure the arrow on the device is pointing to the monitor.

## Connecting device to your MTR

Connect the USB C to A cable with USB-C port inserted into the
SmartVision 60 and USB-A port on MTR.

Note: Ensure the cable is not pulled too tightly or pinched for ideal
data transmission and connectivity.

Login to the MTR as Admin User and change the settings as shown in the
image below.

> ![](media/image6.jpg){width="4.708055555555555in"
> height="2.745833333333333in"}

## Firmware update and enable device log collection.

### Enable device log collection.

Please follow this step here to enable device log collection for
feedback log filing.\
Launch an admin command prompt in the MTR that plaza connects and run
[plazacfg.bat]{.underline} released with this document to config the log
collection and windows driver update endpoint settings properly. And
reboot the MTR to make this take effect.

### Update Device Firmware

Once connected, the Device firmware may need to be updated. To ensure
you have the latest firmware, login to MTR via Admin mode, and perform
"Windows update" to receive the latest Firmware.

## Calibrate to Ignore room monitors.

One must calibrate device to avoid camera detecting faces on monitors
and rendering them on IntelliFrame. Without calibration the images in
the room and faces on the monitor.

1.  Here is the procedure to complete calibration process (Automatic and
    Manual) Download all files at [[PlazaMtrAgent -
    OneDrive]{.underline}](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint-df.com/:f:/p/davidyoon/Ep_FuyiI8B5OmkGI15FhZjIBmM2cJ65yLgPqM2KcmwZcCA?e=a5GFf5)
    [Link](https://microsoft.sharepoint-df.com/teams/AIInnovations/Shared%20Documents/General/HYPERLINK%20%22https:/microsoft-my.sharepoint-df.com/:f:/p/davidyoon/Ep_FuyiI8B5OmkGI15FhZjIBmM2cJ65yLgPqM2KcmwZcCA?e=a5GFf5)

    a.  If it is not accessible to you, please contact CMD team (David
        at [davidyoon@microsoft.com]{.underline})

2.  Log in to MTR with Admin privilege, right click on 'install.bat' and
    'run as administrator.' The app will start the installation.

3.  Open Windows Device Manager and look for "Yealink PANO H264/RAW"
    camera entry under Cameras node.

    a.  If the list of Yealink cameras as shown in the picture do not
        appear under the Cameras section within 2 mins after plugging in
        the device, please check the USB cable or power supply and make
        sure they are firmly connected.

![](media/image7.png){width="1.7534853455818022in"
height="2.4402121609798777in"}

4.  Locate and double click on "PlazaMtrAgent" icon from Desktop.

![](media/image8.png){width="0.7273053368328959in"
height="1.5338681102362204in"}

5.  The Calibration App will open a window where you can **manually**
    select any region in the room to be ignored for face detection. You
    need to manually adjust the area using the upper and lower sliders
    that should be ignored by the camera for face detection.

![](media/image9.png){width="6.676470909886264in"
height="3.783333333333333in"}

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *NOTE: Monitor(s) must be connected to MTR*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  Once you set the ignore region, it will force the "Smart Vision 60"
    to reboot and apply the changes.

**NOTE:** Steps 1-6 will complete the installation and set the ignore
region. If reconfiguration is required, users can launch the calibration
app from the MTR settings.

![](media/image10.png){width="6.609195100612424in" height="3.59375in"}

If you are having repeated issues, we suggest reporting an issue
including device log. The way to transfer log:

1\) Click on \'Log Settings\'

2\) Using toggle switch to enable logging, exit out from the app, and
try to report due the issue while enabling the log

3\) When you can reproduce the issue, please click on \'Transfer log\'
to receive logs from the device. It may take 8-10 minutes to complete
the transfer. The store log will be in the C:\\IntelligentIgnore
(default location) folder.

![](media/image11.png){width="5.672958223972003in"
height="3.7583333333333333in"}

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***NOTE**: After the ignore region is configured, meeting attendees can
  walk through the "ignore space" or even sit in this space and will
  continue to be recognized. Ignore logic will only apply to faces on the
  monitors.*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Unsupported scenarios:**

-   **Glass walls**: Some meeting rooms may have glass walls which allow
    outside people to be visible to the camera. In this scenario there
    is a possibility of accidentally capturing those user faces which
    negatively impacts the meeting experience. We recommend frosting and
    other methods of covering the glass walls to reduce faces outside
    the meeting room from being detected. This will greatly help in
    reducing or even eliminating this issue.

-   **Pictures of people,** the camera does a good job of only detecting
    live people but in cases where there is wind or other unexpected
    camera movement, posted and pictures of the people on the wall may
    be recognized as a person transiently, but can have a negative
    impact in the meeting. Please report these cases to Microsoft using
    the feedback link provided.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Note: We are constantly improving our detection mechanisms and tools,
  any feedback you provide will help us expedite the fixes.*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Enabling Enrollment option and People Recognition

**Preparing "SmartVision 60" to recognize** people's faces and voices in
meetings require following two steps:

### Enabling Face Enrollment

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ### **What is the value for the end user to                           |
| enroll?** {#what-is-the-value-for-the-end-user-to-enroll .unnumbered} |
|                                                                       |
| An Intelligent camera uses Face and Voice profile information of an   |
| "enrolled" user to recognize who is speaking from the intelligent     |
| camera room to enable the following.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| -   Name labels on room participant stage videos                      |
|                                                                       |
| -   Roster entry under call room participants                         |
|                                                                       |
| -   live transcription with recognition (who said what)               |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This step needs CsTeamsMeetingPolicy **enrollUserOverride** tenant
policy to be "**Enabled**". When an Admin applies the policy, face
enrollment option will show up under "Recognition" tab along with voice
enrollment.

> **Note**: Face Enrollment and People Recognition is not intended for
> use in Illinois. Please do not install an intelligent camera in a
> meeting room in Illinois.
>
> **Note**: You are responsible for compliance with local laws and
> regulations when you install an intelligent camera and use Face
> Enrollment and People Recognition in a particular jurisdiction,
> including with respect to obligations around notice, consent, and data
> retention.
>
> **Note**: Please install appropriate signage outside any meeting room
> where you install an intelligent camera advising people about the
> People Recognition, Face Enrollment, and Voice Recognition features.
>
> **Note**: A user needs to enroll for "Voice recognition" before they
> can enroll for "Face recognition"

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **enrollUserOverride** = {Disabled \| Enabled}\
  "*Enabled"- Policy value allows Enrollment tab to be see on individual
  Teams user accounts for registering voice and face profiles*\
  *Default: "Disabled"-- No enrollment tab option*\
  \*This policy should already be enabled if tenant has allowed voice
  enrollment
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

![](media/image12.png){width="4.435050306211724in"
height="2.586165791776028in"}

### Enabling People Recognition {#enabling-people-recognition .unnumbered}

[Note: People Recognition cannot be used in the following states: X, Y
and Z.]{.mark}

This step requires the tenant CsTeamsMeetingPolicy
**roomPeopleNameUserOverride** to be "**On**" for allowing individual
voice and face profiles to be leveraged for recognition in meetings.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **roomPeopleNameUserOverride** = {On \| Off}                          |
|                                                                       |
| *"On"- Policy value allow "People recognition" option on MTR under    |
| call control bar*\                                                    |
| *Default: "Off" -- No People Recognition option on MTR*               |
