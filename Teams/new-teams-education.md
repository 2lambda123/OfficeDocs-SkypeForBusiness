# Update to the new Microsoft Teams for Education 
 
As announced on October 5, 2023, [New Microsoft Teams for Education is now available for Windows and Mac](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/education-blog/new-microsoft-teams-for-education-is-now-available-for-windows/ba-p/3945610) new Teams for Education is ready for users in our Education community.  

Along with our latest innovations in speed, performance, flexibility, and intelligence, this update to new Teams allows us to deliver features and capabilities to our education customers more quickly. All new features and capabilities, including enhancements to existing features, will be available exclusively in the new Teams. 

The new Teams update is seamless for our Education users. Updating is quick and easy and users will be able to pick up exactly where they left off after updating to new Teams.  
 
## Coming soon

In early January 2024, Microsoft will update the client to new Teams on tenants where administrators took no explicit action to update to new Teams via Teams Admin Center policy. Administrators still the option to set classic Teams for their users via policy.  

We encourage you to update to new Teams today. You don't need to wait until January to update. 

Administrators can choose to update their users to new Teams on a different schedule. However, we highly recommend they complete the update by the end of February 2024 to avoid disrupting classes. 

All remaining users of classic Teams will be automatically updated to new Teams after **March 31, 2024**.  

## Set policies for update

It's important that school administrators set the policy to update to new Teams for their users. 

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/). 
2. Select **Teams > Teams Update policies** from the left navigation pane. 
3. Select **Add to create a new policy or select an existing policy to open Update policy 
4. Name the update policy, add a description, and select the setting for “Use the new Teams client”.

5. Select New Teams as default and apply this policy to users in your organization.  
6. Once the policy is set, users select when it will update. Select **Switch now** to update immediately, or **Switch when I'm not using Teams** to automatically install the update after they finish with their current session.

## Blocked downloads or installations

Administrators who have blocked software downloads or installs for users in their tenant, must allow software download or installations of new Teams before setting the policy in the Teams Admin Center to deploy new Teams. To unblock software downloads for their users, learn more at: [Troubleshooting the new Teams installation](new-teams-troubleshooting-installation.md)
