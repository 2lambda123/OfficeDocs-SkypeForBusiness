- **Enhanced support and reliability.** Operators provide technical support and shared service level agreements to improve support service, while direct peering powered by Azure creates a one-to-one network connection for enhanced reliability. 

- **Ability to assign mobile numbers to Teams users.** Your users are able to make PSTN calls from anywhere in India.

- **Ability to assign wired numbers to Teams users.** For more information, see Plan and Configure Location-Based Routing for India.
