**SHOULD WE LINK TO PSTN CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS? OR IS IT MOOT FOR INDIA AND WE WANT TO PUSH THEM TO USE OC INDIA?**

This article describes benefits and requirements, and provides a link to the operators participating in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program.  

Operator Connect for India might be the right solution for your organization if:

- Your preferred operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program.

- You want to find a new operator to enable calling in Teams.

- **ANYTHING ELSE?**

If you decide Operator Connect for India is the right solution for your organization, after reading this article, see [Configure Operator Connect for India](operator-connect-india-configure.md).  

## Benefits

With Operator Connect for India, if your existing operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program, they can manage the service for bringing PSTN calling to Teams. The Operator Connect program provides the following benefits:

- **Leverage existing contracts, or find a new operator.** You keep your preferred operator and contracts, or choose a new one from a selection of participating operators to meet your business needs.

- **Operator-managed infrastructure.** Your operator manages the PSTN calling services and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), allowing you to save on hardware purchase and management.

- **Faster, easier deployment.** You can quickly connect to your operator and assign phone numbers to users -â€“ all from the Teams admin center.

- **Enhanced support and reliability.** Operators provide technical support and shared service level agreements to improve support service, while direct peering powered by Azure creates a one-to-one network connection for enhanced reliability. 

## Requirements

To enable phone number assignments with Operator Connect for India, make sure your users are:

**WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC LICENSE REQUIREMENTS?**
**OTHER REQUIREMENTS?**

- Teams Phone licensed. To learn more, see [What is Phone System?](what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) and [Assign Teams add-on licenses to users](teams-add-on-licensing/assign-teams-add-on-licenses.md).
