## What is the new Teams?

The new Microsoft Teams desktop client for Windows has been re-imagined from the ground up with a performance in mind providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. With new Teams, the client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks. 

New Teams ensures more efficient use of device resources. You can lower memory and disk usage with a Teams app optimized for your device. Whether you have users on multiple accounts or tenants, the new Teams can help eliminate the silos and bring them together in one place, giving them more extensibility and scale.

## Release schedule

The date when Teams starts showing the toggle for users to opt-in to the new Teams depends on which M365/Teams license is assigned to the user and the M365 update channel you're using. See <link> for more details.
The following table shows the schedule.

## When will the new Microsoft Teams be the default client for my users?

## What features are still missing?

While many of the features you're familiar with in classic Teams are already in the new experience, others, like Breakout rooms, are still being worked on. </br>

[**Follow Microsoft Adoption for the latest information on upcoming features for the new Teams.**](https://aka.ms/newTeams).

## What features are changing?

As we improve the client, the experience has been improved to align with similar features. Here are some of the changes you'll see.

|Classic Teams|New Teams|
|:-----|:-----|
|Purple toast notifications|You'll no longer see the purple "toast" notifications, and the taskbar icon will behave a little different. Notifications will be via Windows native notifications to provide a consistent experience.|
|Adding a Wiki to a channel tab|You'll no longer see a Wiki app. Instead, select the Notes app.|
|Adding third party cloud storage service from Files app and Files tab in channels|You'll no longer see the "Add cloud storage" in the Files app on Teams' left navigation bar and within Files tab in Teams' channels. Now you can add the 3rd party storage app directly from the Teams App Store.|
|Look up an organizational chart while in a 1:1 chat |Select a user’s avatar or profile photo anywhere in Teams and navigate to the organizational chart within the profile card.|
|Look up LinkedIn while in a 1:1 chat | Select a user’s avatar or profile photo anywhere in Teams and navigate to the LinkedIn tab within the profile card.|
|Adding a document library (DocLib) app to a tab in channels|Use the Sharepoint app instead. Then add the document library from there as a tab to the channel. Existing document libraries will automatically convert to a SharePoint document library on first use.|
|Activity tab in chat| No longer available|
|Ability to save messages and files in Teams|No longer available. Will be replaced later this year by a similar feature.|
|Allow users to follow another users presence, then notify them of availability|Select a user’s avatar or profile photo anywhere in new Teams to quickly get an overview of their online status, next available calendar slot in Outlook, work hours, local time, and work location (remote or office).|
