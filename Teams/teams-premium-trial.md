# Roll out a Teams Premium trial

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium ECM](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]


To add the Teams Premium trail to Microsoft 365
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand **Billing**, and then select **Purchase services**.
1. Search for *Teams Premium*.
1. Under **Microsoft Teams Premium Trial**, select **Details**.
1. Select **Start free trial**.
1. On the checkout page, select **Try now**.
1. Select **Continue**.

It may take up to 72 hours for Teams Premium sensitivity label settings to be available.

## Planning checklist

30-day trial, so plan before you install.

Create a security group and add trial participants to it. Assign Teams Premium meeting policies to this group, make the templates and labels available to them.


Figure out:
- Label settings for temporary label
- Template types needed and the settings for each
- Images for custom meeting backgrounds
- Logo and images for custom meeting theme
- 

Define use cases
Create post-meeting surveys for participants

## Find a pilot group

- People who hold sensitive meetings
- Branding or comms people

Create a team in Teams for trial participants.

Teams admin / liaison who can make updates to policies, upload new themes, etc.

Decision makers who can evaluate the feedback and sit in on some meetings to see how things work. They may not need a license unless they're testing features themselves.

Give licenses to organizers
Have a feedback line for meeting participants

Not all pilot group members get a license. Some may be business stakeholders who help define use cases, some may be users with licenses.

## Get started

Global admin to assign licenses. They don't need one.
License for Teams admin so they can set things up
License for compliance admin so they can set up labels
Upload images
Assign policies
Create label and publish to security group
Assign licenses to the preview users
