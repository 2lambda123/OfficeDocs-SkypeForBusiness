**Dani's Notes for PMs and writers:**

- The features and capabilities in the table will link out to their respective detail docs.
- The capabilities need to be more descriptive than how we label them internally.
- The descriptions should focus on the enhancements' benefits.
- The order of the enhancements in the table can be changed. I ordered features as they appear in the T-Pre rollout timeline spreadsheet.
