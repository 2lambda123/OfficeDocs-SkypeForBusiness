# Use Teams meeting templates with sensitivity labels

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium ECM](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]



Pivots

presentation meetings vs. interactive

templates for setting defaults even if they can be changed

An advantage of using templates is that you can create multiple templates that use the same sensitivity label which lock different settings. For example, if some of your sensitive meetings are presentations where there is minimal interaction from attendees, you can create a template that turns off attendee video and even chat, and another template that leaves those options to the meeting organizer. Both templates would use the *Sensitive* label.
