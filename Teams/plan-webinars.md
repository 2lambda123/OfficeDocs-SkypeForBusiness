Registered attendees join the webinar with their cameras and mics off; webinar organizers choose when to let attendees turn on their cameras or un-mute.

The features attendees use for interaction during webinars are:

- **Chat:** Attendees can participate in a text-based chat messages during the webinar. Through chat, attendees can ask questions, share thoughts, and engage in discussions with other participants.

- **Q&A**: For a structured question and response format, webinar organizers can enable a dedicated Q&A feature where attendees can submit questions. Organizers or selected presenters can review and answer these questions during the webinar.

- **Reactions**: During webinars, attendees can use reactions to show how they feel or give feedback. These reaction emojis include applause, like, laughter, heart, and surprise. Attendees can click on the reaction icons to display their reactions in real-time.

- **Polls and Surveys**: Webinar organizers can share polls or surveys that attendees can respond to within the webinar experience. This allows organizers to gather feedback, collect opinions, or gauge the audience's understanding of the presented content.

- **Hand Raise**: Attendees can use the "Hand Raise" feature to show that to speak or ask a question. The presenter or organizer can acknowledge and give the attendee an opportunity to speak or address their question.
