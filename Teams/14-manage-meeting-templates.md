# Manage meeting templates in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

Microsoft Teams custom meeting templates (a Teams Premium feature) allow you to specify values for many of the meeting settings available to meeting organizers. Templates can configure settings that meeting organizers can change or can lock settings so that meeting organizers can't change them. For more information about custom meeting templates, see [Overview of custom meeting templates in Microsoft Teams](custom-meeting-templates-overview.md).



To create a custom meeting template

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Meetings** and select **Meeting template policies**.
1. Select **Save**.
