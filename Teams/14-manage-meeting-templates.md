# Manage meeting templates in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

Microsoft Teams custom meeting templates (a Teams Premium feature) allow you to specify values for many of the meeting settings available to meeting organizers. Templates can configure settings that meeting organizers can change or can lock settings so that meeting organizers can't change them. For more information about custom meeting templates, see [Overview of custom meeting templates in Microsoft Teams](custom-meeting-templates-overview.md).

To create a custom meeting template

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Meetings** and select **Meeting templates**.
1. Select **Add**
1. Type a name and description for the template.
1. Choose the settings that you want to use for this template. (See the sections below for descriptions of each setting.)
1. To prevent the meeting organizer from changing a setting, select the setting and then select **lock**.
1. To prevent the meeting organizer from seeing a setting, select the setting and then select **Hide**.
1. Select **Save**.
