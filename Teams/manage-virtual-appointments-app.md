# Manage the Virtual Appointments app for your organization in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature](includes/preview-feature.md)]

The Virtual Appointments app provides a central hub for all your virtual appointments needs in Microsoft Teams. The app enables a seamless end-to-end experience for business-to-customer engagements, integrating schedules from the [Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5), analytics, and management options, all in one place.

You can schedule, view, and manage virtual appointments, get real-time status updates in a queue view, send appointment reminders, view analytics and reports to gain insight into virtual appointments activity, and configure calendar, staff, and booking page settings.

With any Microsoft 365 license, you can use basic Virtual Appointments capabilities to schedule and join business-to-customer meetings. For example, you can schedule appointments in the Bookings calendar and external attendees can [join through a browser](/microsoft-365/frontline/browser-join) without having to download Teams. [Teams Premium](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/enhanced-teams-experience?branch=cmd-teams-premium-overview) (preview) unlocks advanced Virtual Appointments capabilities that your organization can use to manage and personalize the experience. These capabilities include a queue view of scheduled and on-demand appointments, SMS text notifications, custom waiting rooms, and analytics.

## Overview of the Virtual Appointments app

The Virtual Appointments app has the following tabs.

- [Home](#home)
- [Bookings schedule](#bookings-schedule)
- [Queue](#queue)
- [Analytics](#analytics)
- [Manage](#manage)

Here's an overview of what's on each tab.

### Home

### Bookings schedule

You can connect an existing Bookings calendar or create a new one.

### Queue

![Information icon](media/info.png) **The scheduled queue view and SMS notifications are moving to [Teams Premium](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/enhanced-teams-experience?branch=cmd-teams-premium-overview) (preview).

To access the on-demand queue during the preview period, users need a Teams Premium trial license.**

View and monitor all scheduled and on-demand virtual appointments in the Bookings calendar that you pinned, with updates in real time.

From here, schedulers can add a new booking, view relevant appointment details, and see appointment statuses throughout the day. They can also send email reminders to assigned staff and attendees, and send SMS text notifications to attendees for scheduled appointments. Staff can even join appointments directly from the queue.

## Set up the Virtual Appointments app

### Enable or disable the Virtual Appointments app in your organization

The Virtual Appointments app is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on the app at the org level on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps** .
2. In the list of apps, search for the Virtual Appointments app, select it, and then switch the **Status** toggle to **Blocked** or **Allowed**.

### Enable or disable the Virtual Appointments app for specific users in your organization

To allow or block specific users in your organization from using the app, make sure the app is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page. Then create a custom policy for app permissions and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

### Use an app setup policy to pin the Virtual Appointments app to Teams

App setup policies let you customize Teams to highlight the apps that are most important for users in your organization. The apps you set in a policy are pinned to the app bar—the bar on the side of the Teams desktop client and at the bottom of the Teams mobile clients—where users can quickly and easily access them.

To pin the Virtual Appointments app for your users, you can edit the global (Org-wide default) policy. Or, you can create and assign a custom app setup policy. To learn more, see [Manage app setup policies in Teams](teams-app-setup-policies.md).
