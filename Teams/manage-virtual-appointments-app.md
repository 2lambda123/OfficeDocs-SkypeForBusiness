Roles


## Set up the Virtual appointments app

### Enable or disable Virtual appointments in your organization

Virtual appointments is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on the app at the org level on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps** .
2. In the list of apps, search for the Virtual appointments app, select it, and then switch the **Status** toggle to **Blocked** or **Allowed**.

### Enable or disable Virtual appointments for specific users in your organization

To allow or block specific users in your organization from using Virtual appointments, make sure Virtual appointments is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page. Then create a custom app permission policy and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

### Use an app setup policy to pin the Virtual appointments app to Teams

App setup policies let you customize Teams to highlight the apps that are most important for users in your organization. The apps you set in a policy are pinned to the app bar—the bar on the side of the Teams desktop client and at the bottom of the Teams mobile clients—where users can quickly and easily access them.

To pin the Virtual appointments app for your users, you can edit the global (Org-wide default) policy. Or, you can create and assign a custom app setup policy. To learn more, see [Manage app setup policies in Teams](teams-app-setup-policies.md).
