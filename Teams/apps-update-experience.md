# Update apps in Microsoft Teams

In most cases, after app developers publish an app update, the new version automatically appears for users. However, there are some updates to the [Microsoft Teams manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) that require user acceptance to complete:

* A bot was added or removed.
* An existing bot's "botId" property changed.
* An existing bot's "isNotificationOnly" property changed.
* A bot's SupportsCalling, SupportsVideo, and SupportsFiles capability was added.
* A messaging extension was added.
* A new connector was added.
* Permissions inside "Authorization" were added or changed.
