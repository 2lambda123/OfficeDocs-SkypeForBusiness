# Deploy the new Microsoft Teams with Microsoft 365 Apps

Starting in late August, new Teams will be part of new installations of Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows.

Currently, users can install the new Microsoft Teams using the "Try the new Teams" toggle switch in classic Teams or by Admins "bulk" deploying directly to the computers in their organization.

## How to exclude new Microsoft Teams from new installations of Microsoft 365 Apps 

If you don't want new Teams included when you install Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows,  follow these steps to opt out. 

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center (https://config.office.com) with an admin account. 
2. Go to **Customization > Device Configuration > Modern Apps Settings**. 
3. Select **Microsoft Teams**,  then clear the **Enable automatic installation of Microsoft Teams**  check box. 

>[!Note]
>For the best Teams experience, we recommend leaving the setting as is. 

## Direct deploy later

If you prefer to not install new Teams as part of the Microsoft 365 Apps deployment, you can do so later.  Follow the steps in [**Bulk deployment of new Teams**](new-teams-bulk-install-client.md).


## What about Office 365 plans that don't include Microsoft Teams? 
 
Some Office 365 plans include Microsoft 365 Apps, but don't include the Teams service. Teams will still be installed with Microsoft 365 Apps even if a plan doesn't have the Teams service. 

For Office 365 plans that don't include the Teams service, a free trial version of Teams, valid for one year, is available. Your users can start using it when they sign in to Teams. For more information about this free trial version and providing your users access, see Manage the Microsoft Teams Commercial Cloud Trial offer.
