# Update to the new Microsoft Teams for Education 
 
As announced on Oct 5, 2023, New Microsoft Teams for Education is now available for Windows and Mac - Microsoft Community Hub) new Teams for Education is ready for users in our Education community.  

Along with our latest innovations in speed, performance, flexibility and intelligence, this update to new Teams also allows us to deliver features and capabilities to our education customers more quickly. Moving forward, all new features and capabilities, as well as enhancements to existing features, will be available exclusively in the new Teams. 
 
In early January 2024, Microsoft will update your classic Teams client to the new Teams client for all tenants where administrators have not taken any explicit action to update to new Teams via Teams Admin Center policy. Administrators will still have the option to set classic Teams for their users via policy. (For more information on how to update to new Teams via policy, read the sections below) 

We encourage you to update to new Teams today. You do not need to wait until January to update. 

If administrators choose to update their users to new Teams on a different schedule, we highly recommend them to complete the update by end of February 2024 to avoid any disruption to the classes. After March 31, 2024, all remaining users of classic Teams will be automatically updated to new Teams.  


## Seamless for our Education users

Updating to new Teams is quick and easy! Users will be able to pick up exactly where they left off after they’ve updated to new Teams.  


It is important to note that school administrators will need to set the policy to update to new Teams for their users. Instructions for this step are as follows: 

Sign into the Microsoft Teams admin center 

Select Teams > Teams Update policies from the left navigation pane 

Select Add to create a new policy or select an existing policy to open Update policy 

Name the update policy, add a description, and select the setting for “Use the new Teams client”, as shown below. 


## Now available for Windows and Mac

Select New Teams as default and apply this policy to users in your organization.  

Once the policy is set, users will see the following message that will allow them to “Switch now” to update to new Teams quickly and seamlessly, or they can choose “Switch when I’m not using Teams” to automatically install the update once they’ve finished with their current session. 

>[!Note]
>There are different policy settings which you can use to update to new Teams, based on the needs within your school.

How to update to the new Teams where administrators have blocked software downloads or installations by users:
