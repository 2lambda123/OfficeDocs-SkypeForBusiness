# What is Shared Calling

Shared Calling might be the right solution for your organization if you have users who are not heavy users of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). If you have users who do not need an assigned phone number, you should consider Shared Callig as a simpler, easier-to-implement phone solution. 

With Shared Calling, instead of assigning a phone number to every user, the Auto Attendant number/resource account is used instead for inbound and outbound PSTN calls. Users have the same Phone System user experience and features (true?), including the dial pad. 

For more information about Phone System features, see [Here's what you get with Phone System](here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md).
