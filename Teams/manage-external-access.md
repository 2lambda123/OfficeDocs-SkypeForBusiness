# Manage external meetings and chat in Microsoft Teams





## Common external access scenarios

The following sections describe how to enable federation for common external access scenarios, and how the TeamsUpgradePolicy determines delivery of incoming chats and calls.



## User-level controls

When users receive 1:1 chats from someone outside the organization they are presented with a full-screen experience in which they can choose to **Preview** the message, **Accept** the chat, or **Block** the person sending the chat.

Blocking external people is available in multiple places within Teams, including the more (**...**) menu on the chat list and the more (**...**) menu on the people card. Users can also unblock external people via the more (**...**) menu on the chat list, the more (**...**) menu on the people card, or by visiting **Settings** > **Blocked contacts** > **Edit blocked contacts**. Blocking is available prior to or after messages are sent.

Blocking external people prevents them from sending messages in 1:1 chats, adding the user to new group chats, and viewing their presence. While group chat invitations are blocked, blocked users can be in the same chats with users that blocked them either because the chat was initiated prior to the block or the group chat invitation was sent by another member.

> [!NOTE]
> There are no Teams admin settings or policies that control a user's ability to block chats with external people.
