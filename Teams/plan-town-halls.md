# Plan for Teams town halls

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✔️Town halls

 Microsoft Teams town halls bring interactive video streaming to a new level. This event format is meant for one-to-many communications where the town hall organizer or co-organizer is leading the interactions. In town halls, the audience participation is primarily to view and react to the content being shared.

## Recordings and publishing

For town hall recordings, organizers have the ability to:

- Quickly publish a recording with all the right permissions set
- Modify the published recording

As an admin, you control which types of town halls can have their recordings published.

## eCDN

An eCDN (Enterprise Content Delivery Network) takes the video content from the internet and distributes the content throughout your enterprise without impacting network performance. If you and your users have a Teams Premium subscription, you must use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution with town halls.
For all other Teams subscriptions, you can use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution or, alternatively, one of the following certified eCDN partners to optimize your network for town halls held within your organization:

- [Hive](https://www.hivestreaming.com/partners/integration-partners/microsoft/)
- [Kollective](https://kollective.com/ecdn-solutions/microsoft-live-events/)
- [Ramp](https://rampecdn.com/)
- [Riverbed](https://www.riverbed.com/solutions/office-365.html)

For more information about the Microsoft eCDN, see [Introduction to Microsoft eCDN](/ecdn/intro).

## Attendee interaction

Attendees don't use their cameras or microphones during town halls. Instead, attendees interact and engage through the following **Q&A**. As an admin, you can manage which organizers can turn on Q&A for meetings and town halls.

## External participants

External attendees can join a town hall if it’s set to public only.

## Premium town halls

With a Teams premium license, your users have access to extended capabilities. The following table shows a comparison of capabilities between standard and premium town halls.
