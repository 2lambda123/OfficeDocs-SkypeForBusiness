# Plan for Teams town halls

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✔️Town halls

 Microsoft Teams town halls bring interactive video streaming to a new level. Town halls are meant for one-to-many communications where the presenters, organizers, and co-organizers are leading the interactions. The audience participation is primarily to view and react to the content being shared.

## Turn off town halls

Town halls are enabled by default. If you'd like to disable town halls for users in your organization, see [Manage who can schedule town halls](set-up-town-halls.md).

## Get your network ready for town halls

There are four steps you must follow to ensure your network is set up to support town halls.

4. **Optimize your Internal network via eCDN.**<br>
An Enterprise Content Delivery Network (eCDN) takes the video content from the internet and distributes the content throughout your enterprise without impacting network performance. If organizers in your organization have a Teams Premium subscription, they use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution with town halls by default. For organizers with all other Teams subscriptions, you can enable them to use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution or, alternatively, one of the following certified eCDN partners to optimize your network for town halls held within your organization:

- [Hive](https://www.hivestreaming.com/partners/integration-partners/microsoft/)
- [Kollective](https://kollective.com/ecdn-solutions/microsoft-live-events/)
- [Ramp](https://rampecdn.com/)

For more information about the Microsoft eCDN, see [Introduction to Microsoft eCDN](/ecdn/intro).

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft first-party eCDN solution is the default and only option for Premium users.
