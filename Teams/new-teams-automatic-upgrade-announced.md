# Classic Teams users will be automatically updated to new Teams after March 31, 2024

After March 31, 2024, any classic Teams users who have not switched to new Teams, will be automatically updated to new Teams. 

>[!Note]
>This automatic upgrade date does not apply to Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) users.

Between now and March 31, 2024, you can continue to use classic Teams. However, we suggest that classic Teams users update to new Teams as soon as possible to benefit from the new features and capabilities that are only available in new Teams.

## New Teams is now generally available

We recently announced general availability of new Teams for Windows and Mac users. The new Teams app is reimagined from the ground up to deliver improved performance and enhanced reliability, security, and IT management. The result is a faster, simpler, smarter, and more flexible app that is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory.
 


## Servicing agreement

Teams is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy, and it's expected that users remain on the most up-to-date version of the desktop client. Automatic updates ensure that users have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability. An in-app alert is displayed if the userâ€™s current version is between one and three months old, and if there's a new version available.

Learn more about the Modern Lifecycle Policy under the [**Servicing agreement**](/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement) for Microsoft Teams.

>[!Note]
>As stated in the service agreement, Teams desktop app users in government clouds are exempt from this service agreement until further notice.

## How to prepare

As an admin, you can manage how new Teams becomes available to your users. Users can get started on the new Teams today by flipping the toggle in the classic Teams app if your policies allow them to do so.

[**Review policies**](/microsoftteams/new-teams-deploy-using-policies). 
- Admins can enable new Teams in their organizations through robust IT admin policies, which empower them to enable users and groups within their organizations as appropriate. 
- Admins who currently have the Teams update policy set to 'Not enabled' for the 'Use new Teams client' setting, we suggest choosing **New Teams as default** or **Microsoft controlled**.  

[**Review prerequisites.** ](/microsoftteams/new-teams-deploy-using-policies)  Make sure your organization meets the system requirements

[**Bulk upgrade.**](/microsoftteams/new-teams-bulk-install-client)  Bulk upgrades are helpful because users don't need to manually download and install the Teams client. Microsoft provides an executable (.exe) file for the new Teams client so you can upgrade the application directly to the computers in your organization.
