# New Teams for the Mac: Known issues 

There are a few known issues we're working on.

### Desktop

**Issue**: Teams settings are disabled in the Teams menu bar.</br>
**Workaround**: Open Teams settings in the app under the main (â€¦) menu.

### Offline

**Issue**: Offline Message edit, delete, and reactions functionality is currently not supported.</br>
**Workaround:**  Users can still send messages offline in new Teams for Mac.  However for full functionality, use class Teams.

### Meeting Join

**Issue**: Users are not muted despite the tooltip message that says they are.  In large meetings of over 600+ attendees the microphone was still active. </br>
**Workaround:**  Manually mute the call.

**Issue:**  Meeting join shows the wrong call has been joined.</br>
**Workaround:**  Being investigated. No current workaround.
