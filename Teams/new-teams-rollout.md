# Rollout schedule for the new Microsoft Teams desktop client 

>[!Note]
>This article for the new Teams deskstop client. For information about classic Teams, learn more at [classic Teams clients](get-teams-client-md) 

## What is the new Teams?

The new Microsoft Teams desktop client for Windows is the new re-imagined client with performance in mind. New Teams client installs and loads faster, lets you launch the app and join meetings more quickly.

New Teams provides more efficient use of device resources. You can lower memory and disk usage with a Teams app optimized for your device. Whether you have users on multiple accounts or tenants, the new Teams can help eliminate the silos and bring them together in one place, giving them more extensibility and scale.


## Release schedule

The date when Teams starts showing the toggle for users to opt-in to the new Teams depends on which M365/Teams license is assigned to the user and the M365 update channel you're using. See <link> for more details.
