# Using an encoder for live streaming in Microsoft Teams

Teams encoders allow users to produce live events directly from an external hardware or software-based encoder with Microsoft Teams.

## Overview

An encoder takes audio and video content from various sources you use during a live event such as a camera, a microphone, a desktop screen capture, and so on. It compresses and converts that media into a suitable digital format, then sends it to Teams for live streaming to your audience. Consult our [Custom Production playbook](https://aka.ms/CustomProductionVEP) to learn more about how you can use Teams production technologies (such as NDI) with external encoders.

## Production workflow when using an encoder

The workflow for producing a Teams Live Event is as follows:

A live event is scheduled in Teams or Viva Engage, and the **Teams Encoder** option is selected. This provisions an RTMP endpoint, which is provided with an RTMP(S) URL and corresponding key. The URL and key are used by the encoder to connect to the RTMP endpoint for the scheduled live event.

### Common encoders used with live events

The encoders in the following list have been tested by Microsoft for live streaming with Teams. The list is a subset of these encoders, which have been tested with the product for ease of use and quick setup.
