# Upgrade Microsoft Teams Free (classic) to subscription versions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must upgrade from Microsoft Teams Free (classic) to a subscription version of Teams as Microsoft Teams Free (classic) will not be supported from April 12, 2023.

If your organization is using Microsoft Teams Free (classic), you must upgrade to a subscription version by purchasing a Microsoft Teams Essentials/Microsoft 365/Office 365 plan for your users. The subscription versions provide other Teams features — like audio conferencing, enhanced administration, and security capabilities — that the free version doesn't provide. Microsoft 365 and Office 365 combine the familiar Microsoft Office desktop suite with cloud-based versions of Microsoft's next-generation communications and collaboration services — including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Office — to help users be productive from anywhere through the internet. When you upgrade Teams, your existing Teams data won't be lost; all your teams, channels, chats, files, and permissions come with you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription, you're eligible for the trial version of Teams (with your corporate identity), not the free version. The Teams trial provides these subscription versions for a limited time. For more information, see [Manage the Microsoft Teams Commercial Cloud Trial offer](./teams-exploratory.md).

## How does Teams Free (classic) compare to the subscription versions of Teams?

Teams Free (classic) is designed for small to medium businesses and has the following features:

- 500,000 maximum users
- Unlimited chat messages and search
- Guest access
- Integration with apps and services, including the Online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote
- 2 GB of storage per user and 10 GB of shared storage
- 1:1 and group online audio and video calling

A Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan provides the following features in addition to the features that Microsoft Teams Free (classic) provides:

- No user limit (with an enterprise license)
- Exchange email hosting with customer email domain address
- OneDrive, SharePoint, Planner, Yammer, and more Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services
- 1 TB of storage per user
- Scheduled meetings
- Audio conferencing
- Enhanced security and compliance features, including multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, and Auditing (Premium) and reporting
- Administrative controls and support features, including 24 x 7 phone and web support, admin tools for managing users and apps, usage reporting for Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services, service-level agreement, and configurable user settings and policies

## Upgrade requirements

You can upgrade to the subscription versions of Teams if you meet the following requirements:

- You're the person who signed up for the existing Microsoft Teams Free (classic) subscription.
- If you're bringing your own domain, it isn't already associated with Azure Active Directory (via trial or purchased Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription).

> [!NOTE]
> To upgrade and transfer your data, you have to buy your subscription through the upgrade process in the Teams application. If you purchased Microsoft 365 or Office 365 with Teams without going through the upgrade process, you can't transfer your data because you will already have a separate tenant.

## Limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind:

- You can't switch back to Teams Free (classic) after you upgrade.
- You can't merge multiple Teams Free (classic) tenants into a single paid tenant.
- All users must be in the same domain. (All users will get a sign-in in the format *username*@*domain.com*.)
- All users must be upgraded: a mix of Teams Free (classic) and paid subscription users in the same tenant isn't supported.

## How do I upgrade my organization?

1. Launch the URL https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/upgrade.
1. Create your username and password for the account with which you must sign in to Teams.

## What's next?

After your upgrade is complete, perform the following steps:

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to getting started with Teams post-upgrade, ensure that you manage your users in the organization by upgrading them too to the subscribed product, which involves adding user licenses, changing user names, and assigning temporary passwords.
