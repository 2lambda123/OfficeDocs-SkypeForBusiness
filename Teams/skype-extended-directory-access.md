# Manage external meetings and chat with people not managed by an organization

You can configure meetings and chat with people in other organizations by using the *external access* feature in Teams. External access is a way for Teams users from outside your organization to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with you in Teams.

This article covers how to manage external meetings and chat with Teams users not managed by an organization and Skype users.

If you want to limit external meetings and chat to specific users in your organization, see [Limit external meetings and chat to specific users](limit-external-meetings-chat-to-specific-users.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The capabilities discussed in this article aren't available in GCC, GCC High, or DOD deployments, or in private cloud environments.

## Manage chat with external Teams users not managed by an organization

You can choose to enable or disable communications with external unmanaged Teams users (those not managed by an organization). If enabled, you can also control if people with unmanaged Teams accounts can start chats with people in your organization.

To allow chat with unmanaged Teams accounts
1. In the Teams admin center, go to **Users** > **External access**.
1. Turn on the **People in my organization can communicate with Teams users whose accounts aren't managed by an organization** setting.
1. If you want to allow external users to start the conversation, select the **External users with Teams accounts not managed by an organization can contact users in my organization** checkbox.
1. Select **Save**.

Note that if **External users with Teams accounts not managed by an organization can contact users in my organization** is turned off, unmanaged Teams users will not be able to search the full email address to find organization contacts and all communications with unmanaged Teams users must be initiated by organization users.

To prevent chat with unmanaged Teams accounts
1. In the Teams admin center, go to **Users** > **External access**.
1. Turn off the **People in my organization can communicate with Teams users whose accounts aren't managed by an organization** setting.
1. Select **Save**.

## Communicate with Skype users

Follow these steps to let Teams users in your organization chat with and call Skype users. Teams users can then search for and start a one-on-one text-only conversation or an audio/video call with Skype users and vice versa.

### Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation, go to **Users** > **External access**.

2. Turn on the **Allow users in my organization to communicate with Skype users** setting.

To learn more about the ways that Teams users and Skype users can communicate, including limitations that apply, see [Teams and Skype interoperability](teams-skype-interop.md).

### Using PowerShell

Organization level settings can be configured using [Set-CSTenantFederationConfiguration](/powershell/module/skype/set-cstenantfederationconfiguration) and user level settings can be configured using [Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csexternalaccesspolicy).

The following table shows the cmdlet parameters used for configuring federation.

|Configuration|Organization level (Set-CSTenantFederationConfiguration)|User level (Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy)|
|:-------|:--------|:------------------|
|Enable/disable meetings and chat with other Teams organizations and Skype for Business|`-AllowFederatedUsers`|`-EnableFederationAccess`|
|Specify allowed domains|`-AllowedDomains`|Not available|
|Specify blocked domains|`-BlockedDomains`|Not available|
|Enable/disable chat with Teams users that are not managed by an organization|`-AllowTeamsConsumer`|`-EnableTeamsConsumerAccess`|
|Enable/disable Teams users not managed by an organization initiating conversations|`-AllowTeamsConsumerInbound`|`-EnableTeamsConsumerInbound`|
|Enable/disable chat with Skype users|`-AllowPublicUsers`|`-EnablePublicCloudAccess`|

It's important to note that disabling a policy "rolls down" from tenant to users. For example:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTenantFederationConfiguration -AllowFederatedUsers $false
Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy -EnableFederationAccess $true
```

In this example, although the user level policy is enabled, users would not be able to communicate with managed Teams users or Skype for Business users because this type of federation was turned off at the organization level. Therefore, if you want to enable these controls for a subset of users you must turn on the control at an organization level and create two group policies â€“ one that applies to the users that should have the control turned off, and one that applies to the users that should have the control turned on.


### Enable federation between users in your organization and consumer users of Skype

To enable federation between users in your organization and consumer users of Skype:

| If your organization is | Enable consumer federation as follows |
|:---------|:-----------------------|
|Online only with no Skype for Business on-premises. This includes organizations that have TeamsOnly users and/or Skype for Business Online users. | If using Teams Admin Center: <br>-Make sure **Allow users in my organization to communicate with Skype users** is enabled in External Access.<br><br>If using PowerShell: <br>-Ensure the tenant is enabled for federation: `Get-CsTenantFederationConfiguration` must show `AllowPublicUsers=true`. <br> - Ensure the user's effective value of `CsExternalAccessPolicy` has `EnablePublicCloudAccess=true`. |
|On-premises only| In on-premises tools: <br> - Ensure Skype is enabled as a federated partner. <br> - Ensure `EnablePublicCloudAccess=true` for the user through `ExternalAccessPolicy` (either via global policy, site policy, or user assigned policy).|
| Hybrid with some users online (in either Skype for Business or Teams) and some users on-premises.| Follow above steps for both online and on-premises organizations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You don't have to add any **Skype domains** as allowed domains in order to enable Teams or Skype for Business Online users to communicate with Skype users inside or outside your organization. All **Skype domains** are allowed.
