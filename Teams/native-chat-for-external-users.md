# Microsoft Teams chat experience when communicating with people outside the organization

When a Microsoft Teams user is chatting with someone outside the organization, there are two possible chat experiences:

- Native chat - a chat experience that includes formatting, @mentions, emojis, etc.
- Basic chat - a text-only chat experience

Native chat is available when communicating with people in other Microsoft 365 organizations, provided both users are in [Teams only coexistence mode](setting-your-coexistence-and-upgrade-settings.md) and both are in the same cloud environment. (Native chat is not available when communicating between cloud environments, such as GCC to GCC High or commercial cloud.)

Basic chat is available in all other chat experiences, including communicating with:
- Skype for Business users
- Skype users
- Teams users not managed by an organization (those using Microsoft accounts)
