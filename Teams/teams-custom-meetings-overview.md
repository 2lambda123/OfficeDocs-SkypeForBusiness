# Teams Premium meetings customization options

Microsoft Teams has a number of options for meeting customization for organizations with Teams Premium licensing. From templates to meeting themes to custom backgrounds, personalizing the meeting experience and making meeting set-up more efficient has never been easier. If you have a Developer License as well as Teams Premium, Teams Custom Together Mode is also something you can explore.

## Custom Meeting Templates

Creating meeting templates can save time and improve consistency when scheduling recurring meetings. Teams' custom meeting templates feature allows users to create pre-populated meeting invitations with specific settings, attendees, and agendas. This feature is particularly helpful for organizations who need consistency or required elements in their meeting invites, and template elements can be modifiable or locked, depending on the organization's needs.

## Meeting Themes

Meeting themes can be used to add desirable custom elements, such as an organization's branding, to meetings. Once you've set up the customization policy and added theme elements, such as the logos, images, and colors, users will be able to select from these themes to add them to their meetings.

## Custom Meeting Backgrounds

Custom backgrounds allow organizations to put specific elements together for meeting organizers to choose for their backgrounds. After you enable the custom background property and upload your chosen background images, users can select them or (if you allow), upload their own for use in meetings.

## Teams Together Mode

Teams Together Mode uses AI segmentation technology to place meeting participants in a shared virtual space. Teams Together Mode can help make your meetings feel more natural and engaging, and bringing that sense of togetherness to your organization's meetings.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to a Teams Premium license, a Teams Developer license will be needed to implement Teams Together Mode.
