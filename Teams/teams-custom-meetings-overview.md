# Enhancing Meetings with Microsoft Teams: Customization and Collaboration

Microsoft Teams has become an essential tool for remote communication and collaboration. With its various features, users can make their virtual meetings more productive and engaging. In this article, we will explore some of the ways that Teams can be customized to make meetings more effective.

## Custom Meeting Templates

Creating meeting templates can save time and improve consistency when scheduling recurring meetings. Teams' custom meeting templates feature allows users to create pre-populated meeting invitations with specific settings, attendees, and agendas. This feature is particularly helpful for organizations with regular meetings or training sessions.

To create a custom meeting template in Teams, navigate to the Meeting Templates tab in the Teams Admin Center. From there, you can create a new template by specifying the meeting details, such as the agenda, participants, and recurrence. Once created, the template can be shared with other users in your organization, allowing them to easily schedule meetings with the same settings.

## Meeting Themes

Meeting themes can be used to add some fun and personality to virtual meetings. Teams' meeting themes feature allows users to select from a variety of pre-designed themes to customize the meeting background, colors, and fonts.

To apply a meeting theme in Teams, click on the ellipsis icon in the meeting toolbar and select **Change Background Effects**. From there, you can choose a theme or customize the background, such as by adding a custom image or blurring the background.

## Custom Meeting Backgrounds

Custom backgrounds can help users create a more professional or fun meeting atmosphere. Teams' custom backgrounds feature allows users to upload their own images or select from a variety of pre-designed images.

To apply a custom background in Teams, click on the ellipsis icon in the meeting toolbar and select **Change Background Effects**. From there, you can choose a custom image or select from the pre-designed backgrounds.

## Teams Together Mode

Teams Together Mode is a feature that uses AI segmentation technology to place meeting participants in a shared virtual space. This feature can help make meetings feel more natural and engaging, even when participants are not in the same physical location.

To enable Teams Together Mode, click on the ellipsis icon in the meeting toolbar and select **Together Mode**. From there, you can choose from a variety of virtual spaces, such as a conference room or a coffee shop.
