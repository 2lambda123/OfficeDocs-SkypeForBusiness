# Bulk deploy new Microsoft Teams desktop client 

Bulk deployments are useful because users don't need to download and install the Teams client manually. Microsoft provides .exe file for new Teams client so you can bulk deploy the application to the computers in your organization using your choice of software management tool, such as Intune or Configuration Manager.

Bulk deploying of new Teams is to individual computers, not users. Teams will not autolaunch; users will need to manually launch the app when they sign in.  

## How it works

@charlie to add 2-3 sentences about how the new .exe works on users machine
The Teams MSI places an installer in %SystemDrive%\Program Files\Teams Installer on 32-bit Windows and %SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\Teams Installer on 64-bit Windows. Whenever a user signs into a new Windows user profile, the installer is launched and a copy of the Teams app is installed in that user's %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams folder. If a user already has the Teams app installed in the %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams folder, the MSI installer skips the process for that user.
MSI files can't be used to deploy updates. The Teams client will auto-update when it detects a new version is available from the service. To re-deploy the latest installer, use the process of redeploying MSI described below. If you deploy an older version of the MSI file, the client will auto-update (except in VDI environments) when possible for the user. If a very old version gets deployed, the MSI will trigger an app update before the user is able to use Teams.
